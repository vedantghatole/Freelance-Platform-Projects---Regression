ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼ Freelance Platform Project - Regression: Budget Predictions by using Machine Learning algorithms! ðŸš€ðŸ’°

I am happy to share the completion of my latest project, 'Freelance Platform Projects - Regression.' Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, I have developed a powerful regression model that accurately predicts project budgets.
Here's a glimpse into the process:
To perform the necessary steps on the provided dataset, I can guide you through the general process and provide you with the code and steps to follow.
 	EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
ï‚§	Load the dataset: Once you have downloaded the dataset, you can load it using libraries like pandas.
ï‚§	Explore the dataset: Use functions like head(), info(), describe(), and shape to get an overview of the data, check for missing values, data types, and statistical summary.
ï‚§	Analyze features: Look for patterns, distributions, correlations, and outliers in the dataset. Visualize the data using plots (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) from libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
ï‚§	Handle missing values: If there are missing values, decide how to handle them. You can either drop the rows/columns or fill in the missing values with appropriate techniques like mean, median, or mode.
ï‚§	Feature engineering: Transform or create new features if required based on the insights gained from the data.
 	Clustering similar projects:
ï‚§	Preprocess the data: Convert categorical variables to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding if necessary.
ï‚§	Select clustering algorithm: Choose an appropriate clustering algorithm such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering based on the nature of your data and problem.
ï‚§	Scale the data: Normalize or standardize the numerical features using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.
ï‚§	Apply clustering algorithm: Fit the clustering algorithm to the preprocessed data and obtain the clusters.
ï‚§	Evaluate and interpret the results: Analyze the clusters obtained and determine their characteristics and similarities.
 	Regression model to predict the budget:
ï‚§	Preprocess the data: Prepare the dataset for regression by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into input features (X) and target variable (y).
ï‚§	Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using functions like train test split from sklearn.
ï‚§	Select a regression algorithm: Choose an appropriate regression algorithm such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression.
ï‚§	Train the model: Fit the selected regression algorithm to the training data.
ï‚§	Evaluate the model: Use evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared to assess the performance of the regression model.
ï‚§	Fine-tune the model: Adjust hyperparameters if necessary to optimize the model's performance.
 	Classification model to predict the value of the Type column:
ï‚§	Preprocess the data: Prepare the dataset for classification by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into input features (X) and target variable (y).
ï‚§	Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using functions like train test split from sklearn.
ï‚§	Select a classification algorithm: Choose an appropriate classification algorithm such as logistic regression, decision tree classification, or random forest classification.
ï‚§	Train the model: Fit the selected classification algorithm to the training data.
ï‚§	Evaluate the model: Use evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to assess the performance of the classification model.
ï‚§	Fine-tune the model: Adjust hyperparameters if necessary to optimize the model's performance.
